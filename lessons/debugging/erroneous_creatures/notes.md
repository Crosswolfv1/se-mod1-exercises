# DEBUGGING

2 events that lead to debugging:
 - error: your code isnt running
    * common types, common solutions
 - failure: code ran but gave unexpected result
    * anything goes; no standard 

# HAVE A PROCESS

1. read your ERRORS (the whoooooole thing)
2. read your stack trace
    * tells you what lead to the failure happening
3. verify your assumptions
4. try things (research, google, chatgpt, stackoverflow, ruby docs etcetc)
